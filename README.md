CSS Batch
===============

CSS Batch is an open source Rewrite of the Counter Strike Game in Batch for Microsoft Windows.

It was written 2008-2009 during a time where I unfortunately could only use WIndows and get extreme bored....

Note: Most of the UI is in German, do not wonder.

NoteÂ²: My Batch Knowledge are and were very limited so do not be surprised about the miserable and poor "code".
